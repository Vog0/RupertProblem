Title: "Rupert or not Rupert?"

It may appear surprising at first, but doing mathematics is in fact often an exciting process that demands creativity and social interaction. 
While modern mathematics seems to deal with highly abstract problems, generations of mathematicians have been fascinated by a great variety of down-to-earth questions. Many of them are yet to be solved or even discovered.

This image depicts two old friends and young mathematicians who became interested in "Rupert's Problem" and spent months studying and discussing it together.
The problem asks which 3D solids can have a hole cut through them so that a copy of the solid can pass through it. 
Even though the question is elementary, it remains open already for classical polyhedra. 
Working together on this project proved once again to us how colorful mathematics is and how much joy science can bring.
